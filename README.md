# Gluco-Bot

Welcome to Gluco-Bot, a full-stack application dedicated to diabetics. This platform aims to provide valuable resources and tools to assist individuals in managing their diabetes effectively. Whether you're looking for information, predictive models, or a comprehensive diabetes management tracking system, Gluco-Bot has got you covered.

## Chatbot

The Gluco-Bot chatbot is an interactive assistant that provides information about diabetes and guides users on how to utilize the platform effectively. You can find detailed instructions and documentation for the chatbot [here](https://github.com/pfa-ensias/gluco-bot/blob/main/chatbot_v2.0/README.md).

## Diabetes Prediction Model

We have developed a machine learning model that predicts whether a user has diabetes based on various variables and indexes. The model is integrated into a Streamlit app, which allows users to input their data and receive the prediction instantly. You can access the app [here](https://pfa-ensias-gluco-bot-app-diascan-mutjt4.streamlit.app/).

## Ingredients Safety Prediction Model

Another machine learning model within Gluco-Bot is focused on predicting the safety of ingredients in a product. By uploading a picture of the product, the model analyzes the ingredients and provides an assessment. The Streamlit app hosting this model can be found [here](https://pfa-ensias-gluco-bot-ingredients-ingredientssafety1-ac6xtv.streamlit.app/).

## Diabetes Management Tracking System

The Diabetes Management Tracking System is a web-based application designed to assist individuals with diabetes in tracking various aspects of their health. This includes blood glucose levels, diet, physical activity, doctor appointments, and other relevant health data. The system offers a simple and intuitive interface to help users manage their diabetes effectively and improve their overall health outcomes. Detailed instructions for the tracking system can be found [here](https://github.com/pfa-ensias/gluco-bot/blob/main/diabets_tracker-main/README.md).

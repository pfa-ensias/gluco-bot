Our research work includes three major sections. Firstly, we explored online for reliable public datasets of exercise and food with corresponding calories as base records for further calculation. Secondly, we did some searching then selected the most feasible tools, like Python and Django as the kernel for building this application. For database architecture and tools, we used SQLite to create a robust and efficient database system. Thirdly, for the deployment of our app, to ensure that we deploy the application seamlessly, we compared a couple of tools then chose Render, which is free and user-friendly. We realized that we will need an external database portal for storing database entries independently, thus we decided to use PostgreSQL and made the app function as expected.
